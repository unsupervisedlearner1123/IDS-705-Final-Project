### Project Objectives
Malware infection rates have been on the rise in recent years. Given the data deluge the industry currently faces, it is essential to guard our devices well so that the impact from malware attacks can be minimized. Through this analysis, we explore different tree-based models that can predict a Windows machineâ€™s probability of getting infected by malware, based on different hardware and software configurations of that machine. A LightGBM classification model performed the best in our hold-out dataset in predicting if a machine would be infected. We also delve into which features of a device are most sensitive to a malware attack, and it was found that the diagonal display size is particularly sensitive to changes in the underlying sample.

### Data
The dataset used in this analysis was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/microsoft-malware-prediction/data), provided by Microsoft to encourage open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences.
