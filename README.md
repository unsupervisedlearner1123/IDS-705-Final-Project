### Project Objectives
Malware infection rates have been on the rise in recent years. The analysis explores different tree-based models that can predict a Windows machineâ€™s probability of getting infected by malware, based on different hardware and software configurations of that machine. This analysis also delve into which features of a device are most sensitive to a malware attack using the LightGBM Model.

### Data
The dataset used in this analysis was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/microsoft-malware-prediction/data), provided by Microsoft to encourage open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences.
