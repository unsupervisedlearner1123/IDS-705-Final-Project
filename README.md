### Project Objectives
Malware infection rates have been on the rise in recent years. This analysis explore different tree-based models that can predict a Windows machineâ€™s probability of getting infected by malware, based on different hardware and software configurations of that machine. We also delve into which features of a device are most sensitive to a malware attack using the LightGBM Model.
